                            <p> The first campaign of excavations at Kınık Höyük lasted from August
                                to October 2011. Three operations were opened, labeled A, B and C,
                                following the results of <a href="geophysic.html" rel="nofollow"> the
                                    geophysical survey performed in 2010. </a> In particular,
                                Operations A and C investigated the citadel walls, on the northern
                                and south-western slopes of the mound respectively, while Operation B
                                was opened on the top of the mound, aiming to investigate extensively
                                the large stone structure indicated by the GPR. </p>
                            <p> In 2011, Operation B consisted of three squares of 10x10 meters,
                                forming a rectangle oriented north-south measuring 300m <sup>2</sup>
                                in total. The 2011 excavation campaign uncovered two levels,
                                characterized by stone architecture dating to the Medieval Period. </p>
                            <p> The first level is represented by one room found on the eastern edge
                                of the central square. Few materials were found in the soil
                                accumulations associated with this room though, and because the soil
                                is so close to the surface, its precise dating is speculative. </p>
                            <p> The second level consists of remains of domestic architecture and an
                                open working area. The architecture is constructed of two-row walls,
                                which are 70-90 cm. thick and preserved for a height of about 50 cm.
                                They are quite irregular, and use unshaped stones without any use of
                                binders. In the northern square, the stone walls defining two rooms
                                of a building are easily discernible; the eastern room with a surface
                                of nine square meters has been entirely excavated until we reached a
                                hard clay floor. In the northern part of the eastern wall a
                                well-preserved doorway opened toward an alley oriented north-south,
                                dividing this building from another one. In this alley beside the
                                doorway a tandır associated with the building was found. Here and
                                elsewhere several modern pits cut the architecture: these
                                occasionally caused difficulties in the collection of homogeneous
                                assemblages of materials. The central and southern sector of
                                Operation B is characterized by retaining walls and installations,
                                whose functions are difficult to understand. Ceramics found in this
                                level can be dated to the Medieval Period. The dating is supported by
                                the comparison with the excavations of the medieval levels at nearby
                                excavations of Tyana Kemerhisar, and we owe this information to a
                                strong cooperation between the two missions. However, assemblages are
                                rarely homogeneous and Hellenistic sherds are found in most of
                                Operation B’s stratigraphic units. In addition to the operation on
                                the top of the mound, two operations, labeled A and C, were opened on
                                the slopes of the mound. </p>
                            <p> Operation A occupies the northern side just above the edge of a huge
                                pit used in modern times as a stone quarry for building materials.
                                Since the geomagnetic survey did not show the presence of citadel
                                walls in this area, we assumed that they had been removed while
                                digging in the quarry. Thus our goal in this operation was to obtain
                                a stratigraphic window into the earliest levels of the mound. After
                                removing the topsoil, we reached an accumulation of repositioned
                                mud-bricks. Here, a pit was cut in order to accommodate a small jar
                                containing a necklace made of glass beads of different colors, sizes
                                and shapes. The glass beads are all rod-shaped and decorated with
                                colored applique bands or pellets. Apart from some eye beads, whose
                                production is already well attested in the second millennium BC, most
                                of them find good parallels in productions ranging from the Middle
                                Iron Age down to the first century BC. </p>
                            <p> Under the thick accumulation of repositioned mud-bricks, we found a
                                stone masonry belonging to the citadel’s fortification wall. This
                                massive east-west structure is over four meters wide. Upon this
                                discovery our strategy changed, and a two-meter wide sounding
                                perpendicular to the outer face of the citadel wall was opened in
                                order to investigate the slope’s stratigraphy. </p>
                            <p> At the end of the campaign more than five meters of the outer face of
                                the wall were exposed, and the foundations of the walls were not yet
                                reached. Two main phases of this wall were identified. The later
                                phase is built with the “Schalenmauer” technique: inner and outer
                                faces are made of larger unshaped stones, whereas the stones in the
                                center of the wall are smaller, rarely exceeding a diameter of about
                                thirty to thirty-five centimeters. A clay mortar was used to
                                stabilize the structure. </p>
                            <p> On the outer face of the wall a ten-centimeter thick layer of mud
                                plastering with vegetal inclusions was preserved. The adherence of
                                this coating to the stone face of the walls was possibly implemented
                                by small wooden logs, organized in six irregular horizontal rows.
                                These wooden elements would have protruded from the wall’s surface in
                                the plastering. This reconstruction is based on the presence of wood
                                remnants inside the holes, which are still preserved in the plaster.
                                Similar wall plastering has been detected elsewhere in fortification
                                walls of pre-classical Anatolia, but the example from Kınık Höyük is
                                noteworthy, because of its exceptional state of preservation. About
                                three meters below the top of the wall there is a slanting clay
                                rampart associated with the wall plaster, under which two more meters
                                of stone masonry, representing the earlier phase of the wall, were
                                exposed. These rows, however, are constructed from slightly smoothed
                                blocks with diameters of about 50-60 centimeters, and are not covered
                                by plastering. The profile shows that an edge of this earlier phase
                                projects for about 1.30 meters beyond the wall face of the later
                                phase. The eastern face of a second north-south wall was exposed in
                                the western section of the sounding. This wall works with the earlier
                                phase of the citadel walls, and shares its characteristic large
                                dimensions and working of the face blocks. </p>
                            <p> The citadel walls were also investigated in operation C, on the
                                southwestern slope of the mound. In order to keep the walls in the
                                best state of preservation, in view of its stabilization, four
                                soundings were opened instead of one extensive excavation area. In
                                each sounding a similar situation emerged: uphill levels, which abut
                                or work with the inner face of the citadel stone walls; the citadel
                                walls, covering the central part of the soundings; and finally, the
                                downhill levels, which abut on the outer face of the wall. The wall’s
                                building technique and dimensions are the same as those of the walls
                                excavated in operation A, and the dimensions and the smoothing of the
                                blocks on the outer face possibly indicate that they belong to the
                                earlier phase attested in A. Since the downhill levels were
                                investigated in operation A, investigations in C were mainly
                                concentrated on the uphill levels in order to understand the
                                relationship between the wall and the stratigraphy of the inner
                                citadel. Uphill stratigraphy in all of the soundings presents a
                                series of one to three clay floors, often associated with mud-brick
                                or stone architectural remains. The ceramic repertoire of the
                                different floors is quite homogenous and can be primarily dated to
                                the Middle to Late Iron Age. The finest piece of pottery found in
                                Operation C is a fragment of a carinated cup with an applied deer
                                motif. The decorative technique used on this sherd is unusual: it is
                                not the normal painted ware, but figures were shaped, moulded or even
                                possibly cut out, applied to the cup and then painted. The deer motif
                                represented in a clear silhouette style is strongly reminiscent of
                                the silhouette deer iconography on the Alishar IV production, well
                                known from many sites of Central Anatolia. </p>
                            <p> In sounding 3 a thick layer of collapsed mudbrick was partially
                                covering the upper section of the citadel wall and collapsed inward.
                                The context indicates that these mudbricks constituted the
                                superstructure of the walls. Since the mud-brick debris was sealed by
                                three floors with Iron Age sherds in situ, a dating of the walls
                                phase excavated in operation C before the Middle to Late Iron Age is
                                assured. The dating of the walls in Operation A is still up for
                                debate, but seems to match the results achieved in C. Though using
                                different materials, the parallels drawn with the walls of the
                                neighboring sites of Porsuk and Alishar could offer further
                                information for dating the later phases- in the least for the Middle
                                Iron age. </p>

                                <p>Op. A in 2012</p>
                            </div>
                            <p> The second excavation season at Kınık Höyük lasted from June to
                                August 2012. Works focused on two Operations, A and B, in both cases
                                extending the excavation of 2011. During the 2011 season, in Op. A we
                                had exposed the monumental citadel walls. In 2012 the excavation area
                                was enlarged in two directions, west and south. Towards the west
                                (Area A1), the aim was to expose the continuation of the citadel
                                wall, while the enlargement towards the south intended to investigate
                                the inner structures of the citadel (Area A2), clarifying their
                                stratigraphic and planimetric relationships with the wall. </p>
                            <p> In area A1, under the topsoil, we unearthed a series of 4 levels, all
                                dating to the Late Iron Age. The first level is characterized by a
                                production area, used in two phases. The first phase comprised a
                                floor pierced by a series of pits, of which two contained ashes and
                                other traces of burnt material. A small olla for cooking, perfectly
                                preserved, was unearthed in this phase, together with various ceramic
                                and glass slags. Underneath this phase, the second phase comprised a
                                clay floor, associated with a series of pits and a small
                                half-interred mud brick oven. A complete red burnished plate was
                                found within the oven. </p>
                            <p> The second Late Iron Age level (Level 2) comprised a small stone wall
                                running E-W abutted by a lamination of several clay floors, many
                                patched by ash spots. This level is well preserved only in the
                                north-eastern sector of the excavated area, while to the south-west
                                it is badly eroded and cut by the Level 1 pits. </p>
                            <p> Underneath Level 2, a series of several other floors, apparently not
                                associated with any structure, represented another level (Level 3).
                                Significantly, from these floors and the above lying accumulations we
                                recovered a rich assemblage of ceramic sherds, among which there were
                                also fragments of a pitcher with a painted polychrome flower. </p>
                            <p> The fourth Late Iron Age level (Level 4) was characterized by well
                                constructed architecture. This comprised a mud brick wall with stone
                                socle running N-S, perpendicularly to the citadel wall. To the north
                                it formed a corner with another mud brick wall running E, breaking up
                                after ca. 1 m, perhaps in connection to a sort of passage or doorway
                                for the building. Both the N-S and the W-E wall were plastered, maybe
                                even painted as traces on the former seemed to reveal. The room
                                defined by the two walls was not excavated, but we completely exposed
                                the mud-brick debris sealing it. To the south the room was defined by
                                a second W-E. Here the area was quite disturbed by pits dug from the
                                levels above, but it has been possible to expose a third W-E wall. It
                                probably defined another room, the western sector of which preserved
                                a well-made floor, paved with large stones. Area A1 is the western
                                extension the 2011 excavations in Operation A, where the imposing
                                structure of the citadel wall was exposed for 4.5 m in width and 6m
                                in height. On the northern facade of the wall, the sole face exposed
                                thus far, we found a perfectly preserved 10 cm thick layer of
                                plaster. In 2012 we opened a 12x10 m excavation area following
                                westwards the orientation of the wall. At the end of the works in the
                                area, we discovered that, after it fell into disuse, the citadel wall
                                was heavily plundered along its whole thickness, in order to obtain
                                building materials ready for other structures. Only the southern
                                limit of the wall remained untouched by looting activities. Just
                                above these meager remains of the citadel wall ran a mud brick wall
                                with stone socle, joining with the Level 4 structures that emerged in
                                the Area A 2. This wall defined a space occupied by a paved floor, a
                                wide hearth and a couple of large interred pithoi. A third pithos,
                                provided with lid, was lying on another paved floor pertaining to a
                                second space of the same structure. </p>
                            <p> The last two phases investigated in Area A1 lie in the western
                                sector. Both are domestic contexts, very badly preserved because of
                                their proximity to the topsoil. In the north-western corner the
                                remains of a plastered floor are associated with an E-W mud brick
                                wall. To the north of these remains, two interconnected walls have
                                been unearthed, one of which is leaning above the filling of the
                                citadel wall spoil trench filling. </p>
                            <p> Operation B, located on the top of the mound, was also enlarged in
                                two directions. A first enlargement to the north-west, (Area B2)
                                aimed to extensively investigate the stone architecture that emerged
                                during the 2011 season. In particular we brought to light a new room
                                of the building exposed in 2011, together with a hall shaped as an
                                "8" lying to the south, found completely filled with stone debris.
                                Investigations on the floor sequence and their relations to the walls
                                finally allowed us to understand the different phases of structure
                                function. Already during the 2011 campaign we had noticed the
                                presence of both medieval and Hellenistic materials in the
                                accumulations above the floors of this architecture. Thanks to our
                                2012 work it is now clear that the structures extending to the north
                                of Op. B represent different phases of manipulation of a Hellenistic
                                building (Level 3), whose remains have been apparently reused also
                                during the Medieval Period (Levels 1-2). Some medieval installations
                                seem to have served for feeding and watering animals and seem to
                                reveal the rural nature of the settlement during that period. The
                                medieval masonry directly leans on coeval floors, without contacts to
                                the preceding floors, associated with the original Hellenistic
                                edition of the structure. </p>
                            <p> Area B1 is the southern elongation of the 2011 excavation area in
                                Operation B. In the northern sector of the area a series of medieval
                                layers have been brought to light, directly associated with the
                                northern levels. The uppermost level (Level 1) comprised a circular
                                stone structure with a diameter of 5m ca., recalling the typical
                                structures or fences nowadays used by local herdsmen. The
                                architecture found in the level underneath (Level 2) was quite poor,
                                comprising a house provided with very small rooms, barely preserved
                                clay floors and defined by single-lined stone walls.  Outside this
                                house, we found three broken storage jars, reused as trash bins or
                                ovens. </p>
                            <p> All traces of medieval occupation disappear in the levels below
                                (Level 3-4), giving way to badly eroded levels, disturbed by
                                activities of the preceding phases. Here the poor remains of a mud
                                brick wall have been found, whose relationships with other exposed
                                structures are very difficult to establish. The associated floors are
                                also poorly preserved and extant only in small portions. Judging from
                                stratigraphical sequence and ceramic findings, Levels 3 and 4 are to
                                be dated to the Hellenistic period. Below these levels, the
                                excavation was stopped after exposing the top of a large mud brick
                                wall running NW-SE, likely dating to the Iron Age. Significantly,
                                this mud brick wall runs parallel to a 1.50 m thick stone wall
                                uncovered immediately below the topsoil along the southern edge of
                                Area B1. However, this latter wall lies at a much higher elevation
                                then the mud brick wall, but it is cut by Hellenistic pits, leaving
                                the dating to the Iron Age as a possibility. </p>

                            <h3>2013</h3>
                            <p> The 2013 excavation season, lasting from June to August, has
                                especially concerned the levels of Period III, dating to the
                                Achaemenid occupation of the site. Besides continuing the work
                                started in 2011 in the Operations A and B, in 2013 a new operation
                                (Operation D) was opened in the lower terrace of the site, along its
                                western borders. The joint investigation in the Operations A, B and D
                                unexpectedly revealed the relevance the site must have had during the
                                Achemenid period. In addition to the excavation, the first <a
                                    href="preservation.html" rel="nofollow"> restoration and
                                    preservation works </a> were carried out, focusing on the citadel
                                wall exposed in Op. A during the 2011 and 2012 campaigns. </p>
                            <p> In the Area A1 of Operation A investigations have extended westwards.
                                The first level excavated in this area (Level A1.1) was lacking major
                                structures but, judging from the findings, including a small hoard of
                                13 bronze coins, can be dated to the Hellenistic period. Below the
                                Hellenistic level, we found a series of floors in relationship with
                                two badly preserved walls, forming the north-eastern corner of a
                                small space. The materials recovered from the floors and the
                                accumulations in between allow us to date their disposal to the
                                Achaemenid period, between the 6th and 4th century BC. The findings
                                in these levels of Area A1 are extraordinary in terms of both quality
                                and quantity. In fact, in addition to fine ceramic sherds, many of
                                which display painted decorations, we found a large amount of
                                terracottas, many zoomorphic and one anthropomorphic, representing a
                                female figure. Added to a fragment of architectural decoration, these
                                findings let us hypothesize that the levels constituted part of a
                                worship area of very high importance. </p>
                            <p> In the Area A2 of Operation A (squares 17.14-17.19-17.13-17.18), a
                                first level dating to the Hellenistic period (Level A2.1) has been
                                found, below which four levels dating to the Late Iron Age have been
                                excavated (A2.2-5). The first among these latter levels bore elements
                                of a workshop area, equipped with a furnace, half interred ovens,
                                working surfaces and rubbish pits with slags of various materials.
                                During the 2013 campaign we continued to expose the imposing E-W mud
                                brick wall unearthed in 2012, possibly dating to the 7th century.
                                Thus, works revealed this wall to be 13 m long, straddling squares
                                17.13 and 17.18. </p>
                            <p> Work in Operation B focused on its central area. Here, we first
                                investigated the medieval and Hellenistic levels (Levels B.1-4),
                                already partially exposed in 2011 and 2012. These levels,
                                particularly those dating to the Medieval Period (Levels B.1-2), were
                                characterized by a series of pits, several large (reaching 3 m in
                                diameter), cutting the preceding levels of occupation. This pitting
                                heavily hindered the possibility to fully understand stratigraphical
                                relationships between the different levels. The south-western sector
                                of Operation B was better preserved compared to the central sector.
                                In particular, we brought to light stone structures and floors
                                associated with a Hellenistic house reused and modified in the
                                Medieval Period. The southern half of square 16.16 was entirely
                                occupied by structures of a monumental building, whose main element
                                was a massive 1m thick and 10m long mud brick wall. This wall,
                                oriented SE-NW, formed at its eastern ending a corner with a NW-SE
                                wall, preserving traces of a white plastering. In this corner we
                                opened a deep sounding that, while not yet reaching the original
                                floor of the room, revealed the walls to be preserved for the
                                extraordinary elevation of more than 2m. The deep sounding, moreover,
                                reached several intermediate floor levels, indicating multiple stages
                                of reutilization of the large structure after its first installation
                                (Levels B.5-7). The accumulations and the debris leaning against the
                                wall and filling the large room produced ceramic materials dating to
                                the Achaemenid period. Moreover, in the bottom of the sounding a
                                circular mud brick installation forming a quarter of circle joined to
                                the two perpendicular walls has been found. In the filling of this
                                installation, probably a trash bin, two complete ceramic bowls have
                                been found, both pertaining to a Late Iron Age horizon. </p>
                            <p> The new Operation opened in 2013 (Operation D) occupies the western
                                limit of the lower terrace of Kınık Höyük (square 1.15). The latest
                                level delineated here, lying a few centimeters below the topsoil, was
                                heavily disturbed and dates to the Medieval Period. This level (Level
                                D.1) displayed very different features from those of the medieval
                                settlement in Operation B, and some findings suggest an earlier
                                dating to the Byzantine period. If confirmed, this hypothesis would
                                attest the presence at Kınık of a Byzantine settlement limited to the
                                lower town and not involving the mound itself. In the north-eastern
                                corner of Operation D, we found a small space, demarcated by stone
                                walls. It is likely attributable to a Hellenistic level (Level D.2),
                                judging from the materials produced by the fillings. Investigations
                                south-west of this room suggest that it could have been associated to
                                some craft production activities. Below the Hellenistic level we
                                unearthed a small space (Level D.3), defined by two mud brick walls
                                and a small stone wall, maybe pertaining to an earlier phase. Judging
                                from the hardness of the mud bricks, possibly produced as an effect
                                of burning, the presence of many ash accumulations and the recovery
                                of oven remains, this was an industrial area, maybe for the
                                processing of foodstuffs or even of metals, as apparently suggested
                                by some slags retrieved in the surroundings. Ceramic materials,
                                including a fragment of a painted lekythos, provide a dating of Level
                                D.3 to the Achemenid period. </p>
                            <p> In 2013 the restoration work for the outer facade of the citadel wall
                                has started. Functional to the restoration work, we carried out
                                archaeological excavation in the area, which brought to light the
                                construction phase of the wall itself, corresponding to the most
                                ancient level so far reached at Kınık (Level A.8). Moreover, the
                                excavation to better expose the facade led to the reconnaissance of a
                                rampart, covering the most ancient construction phase of the wall and
                                associated to the most recent one. </p>

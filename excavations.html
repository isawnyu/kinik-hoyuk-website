                            </div>
                            <p> The first campaign of excavations at Kınık Höyük lasted from August
                                to October 2011. Three operations were opened, labeled A, B and C,
                                following the results of <a href="geophysic.html" rel="nofollow"> the
                                    geophysical survey performed in 2010. </a> In particular,
                                Operations A and C investigated the citadel walls, on the northern
                                and south-western slopes of the mound respectively, while Operation B
                                was opened on the top of the mound, aiming to investigate extensively
                                the large stone structure indicated by the GPR. </p>
                            <p> In 2011, Operation B consisted of three squares of 10x10 meters,
                                forming a rectangle oriented north-south measuring 300m <sup>2</sup>
                                in total. The 2011 excavation campaign uncovered two levels,
                                characterized by stone architecture dating to the Medieval Period. </p>
                            <p> The first level is represented by one room found on the eastern edge
                                of the central square. Few materials were found in the soil
                                accumulations associated with this room though, and because the soil
                                is so close to the surface, its precise dating is speculative. </p>
                            <p> The second level consists of remains of domestic architecture and an
                                open working area. The architecture is constructed of two-row walls,
                                which are 70-90 cm. thick and preserved for a height of about 50 cm.
                                They are quite irregular, and use unshaped stones without any use of
                                binders. In the northern square, the stone walls defining two rooms
                                of a building are easily discernible; the eastern room with a surface
                                of nine square meters has been entirely excavated until we reached a
                                hard clay floor. In the northern part of the eastern wall a
                                well-preserved doorway opened toward an alley oriented north-south,
                                dividing this building from another one. In this alley beside the
                                doorway a tandır associated with the building was found. Here and
                                elsewhere several modern pits cut the architecture: these
                                occasionally caused difficulties in the collection of homogeneous
                                assemblages of materials. The central and southern sector of
                                Operation B is characterized by retaining walls and installations,
                                whose functions are difficult to understand. Ceramics found in this
                                level can be dated to the Medieval Period. The dating is supported by
                                the comparison with the excavations of the medieval levels at nearby
                                excavations of Tyana Kemerhisar, and we owe this information to a
                                strong cooperation between the two missions. However, assemblages are
                                rarely homogeneous and Hellenistic sherds are found in most of
                                Operation B’s stratigraphic units. In addition to the operation on
                                the top of the mound, two operations, labeled A and C, were opened on
                                the slopes of the mound. </p>

                            <p> Operation A occupies the northern side just above the edge of a huge
                                pit used in modern times as a stone quarry for building materials.
                                Since the geomagnetic survey did not show the presence of citadel
                                walls in this area, we assumed that they had been removed while
                                digging in the quarry. Thus our goal in this operation was to obtain
                                a stratigraphic window into the earliest levels of the mound. After
                                removing the topsoil, we reached an accumulation of repositioned
                                mud-bricks. Here, a pit was cut in order to accommodate a small jar
                                containing a necklace made of glass beads of different colors, sizes
                                and shapes. The glass beads are all rod-shaped and decorated with
                                colored applique bands or pellets. Apart from some eye beads, whose
                                production is already well attested in the second millennium BC, most
                                of them find good parallels in productions ranging from the Middle
                                Iron Age down to the first century BC. </p>
                            <p> Under the thick accumulation of repositioned mud-bricks, we found a
                                stone masonry belonging to the citadel’s fortification wall. This
                                massive east-west structure is over four meters wide. Upon this
                                discovery our strategy changed, and a two-meter wide sounding
                                perpendicular to the outer face of the citadel wall was opened in
                                order to investigate the slope’s stratigraphy. </p>
                            <p> At the end of the campaign more than five meters of the outer face of
                                the wall were exposed, and the foundations of the walls were not yet
                                reached. Two main phases of this wall were identified. The later
                                phase is built with the “Schalenmauer” technique: inner and outer
                                faces are made of larger unshaped stones, whereas the stones in the
                                center of the wall are smaller, rarely exceeding a diameter of about
                                thirty to thirty-five centimeters. A clay mortar was used to
                                stabilize the structure. </p>
                            <p> On the outer face of the wall a ten-centimeter thick layer of mud
                                plastering with vegetal inclusions was preserved. The adherence of
                                this coating to the stone face of the walls was possibly implemented
                                by small wooden logs, organized in six irregular horizontal rows.
                                These wooden elements would have protruded from the wall’s surface in
                                the plastering. This reconstruction is based on the presence of wood
                                remnants inside the holes, which are still preserved in the plaster.
                                Similar wall plastering has been detected elsewhere in fortification
                                walls of pre-classical Anatolia, but the example from Kınık Höyük is
                                noteworthy, because of its exceptional state of preservation. About
                                three meters below the top of the wall there is a slanting clay
                                rampart associated with the wall plaster, under which two more meters
                                of stone masonry, representing the earlier phase of the wall, were
                                exposed. These rows, however, are constructed from slightly smoothed
                                blocks with diameters of about 50-60 centimeters, and are not covered
                                by plastering. The profile shows that an edge of this earlier phase
                                projects for about 1.30 meters beyond the wall face of the later
                                phase. The eastern face of a second north-south wall was exposed in
                                the western section of the sounding. This wall works with the earlier
                                phase of the citadel walls, and shares its characteristic large
                                dimensions and working of the face blocks. </p>
                            <p> The citadel walls were also investigated in operation C, on the
                                southwestern slope of the mound. In order to keep the walls in the
                                best state of preservation, in view of its stabilization, four
                                soundings were opened instead of one extensive excavation area. In
                                each sounding a similar situation emerged: uphill levels, which abut
                                or work with the inner face of the citadel stone walls; the citadel
                                walls, covering the central part of the soundings; and finally, the
                                downhill levels, which abut on the outer face of the wall. The wall’s
                                building technique and dimensions are the same as those of the walls
                                excavated in operation A, and the dimensions and the smoothing of the
                                blocks on the outer face possibly indicate that they belong to the
                                earlier phase attested in A. Since the downhill levels were
                                investigated in operation A, investigations in C were mainly
                                concentrated on the uphill levels in order to understand the
                                relationship between the wall and the stratigraphy of the inner
                                citadel. Uphill stratigraphy in all of the soundings presents a
                                series of one to three clay floors, often associated with mud-brick
                                or stone architectural remains. The ceramic repertoire of the
                                different floors is quite homogenous and can be primarily dated to
                                the Middle to Late Iron Age. The finest piece of pottery found in
                                Operation C is a fragment of a carinated cup with an applied deer
                                motif. The decorative technique used on this sherd is unusual: it is
                                not the normal painted ware, but figures were shaped, moulded or even
                                possibly cut out, applied to the cup and then painted. The deer motif
                                represented in a clear silhouette style is strongly reminiscent of
                                the silhouette deer iconography on the Alishar IV production, well
                                known from many sites of Central Anatolia. </p>
                            <p> In sounding 3 a thick layer of collapsed mudbrick was partially
                                covering the upper section of the citadel wall and collapsed inward.
                                The context indicates that these mudbricks constituted the
                                superstructure of the walls. Since the mud-brick debris was sealed by
                                three floors with Iron Age sherds in situ, a dating of the walls
                                phase excavated in operation C before the Middle to Late Iron Age is
                                assured. The dating of the walls in Operation A is still up for
                                debate, but seems to match the results achieved in C. Though using
                                different materials, the parallels drawn with the walls of the
                                neighboring sites of Porsuk and Alishar could offer further
                                information for dating the later phases- in the least for the Middle
                                Iron age. </p>

                                <p>Op. A in 2012</p>
                            </div>
                            <p> The second excavation season at Kınık Höyük lasted from June to
                                August 2012. Works focused on two Operations, A and B, in both cases
                                extending the excavation of 2011. During the 2011 season, in Op. A we
                                had exposed the monumental citadel walls. In 2012 the excavation area
                                was enlarged in two directions, west and south. Towards the west
                                (Area A1), the aim was to expose the continuation of the citadel
                                wall, while the enlargement towards the south intended to investigate
                                the inner structures of the citadel (Area A2), clarifying their
                                stratigraphic and planimetric relationships with the wall. </p>
                            <p> In area A1, under the topsoil, we unearthed a series of 4 levels, all
                                dating to the Late Iron Age. The first level is characterized by a
                                production area, used in two phases. The first phase comprised a
                                floor pierced by a series of pits, of which two contained ashes and
                                other traces of burnt material. A small olla for cooking, perfectly
                                preserved, was unearthed in this phase, together with various ceramic
                                and glass slags. Underneath this phase, the second phase comprised a
                                clay floor, associated with a series of pits and a small
                                half-interred mud brick oven. A complete red burnished plate was
                                found within the oven. </p>
                            <p> The second Late Iron Age level (Level 2) comprised a small stone wall
                                running E-W abutted by a lamination of several clay floors, many
                                patched by ash spots. This level is well preserved only in the
                                north-eastern sector of the excavated area, while to the south-west
                                it is badly eroded and cut by the Level 1 pits. </p>
                            <p> Underneath Level 2, a series of several other floors, apparently not
                                associated with any structure, represented another level (Level 3).
                                Significantly, from these floors and the above lying accumulations we
                                recovered a rich assemblage of ceramic sherds, among which there were
                                also fragments of a pitcher with a painted polychrome flower. </p>
                            <p> The fourth Late Iron Age level (Level 4) was characterized by well
                                constructed architecture. This comprised a mud brick wall with stone
                                socle running N-S, perpendicularly to the citadel wall. To the north
                                it formed a corner with another mud brick wall running E, breaking up
                                after ca. 1 m, perhaps in connection to a sort of passage or doorway
                                for the building. Both the N-S and the W-E wall were plastered, maybe
                                even painted as traces on the former seemed to reveal. The room
                                defined by the two walls was not excavated, but we completely exposed
                                the mud-brick debris sealing it. To the south the room was defined by
                                a second W-E. Here the area was quite disturbed by pits dug from the
                                levels above, but it has been possible to expose a third W-E wall. It
                                probably defined another room, the western sector of which preserved
                                a well-made floor, paved with large stones. Area A1 is the western
                                extension the 2011 excavations in Operation A, where the imposing
                                structure of the citadel wall was exposed for 4.5 m in width and 6m
                                in height. On the northern facade of the wall, the sole face exposed
                                thus far, we found a perfectly preserved 10 cm thick layer of
                                plaster. In 2012 we opened a 12x10 m excavation area following
                                westwards the orientation of the wall. At the end of the works in the
                                area, we discovered that, after it fell into disuse, the citadel wall
                                was heavily plundered along its whole thickness, in order to obtain
                                building materials ready for other structures. Only the southern
                                limit of the wall remained untouched by looting activities. Just
                                above these meager remains of the citadel wall ran a mud brick wall
                                with stone socle, joining with the Level 4 structures that emerged in
                                the Area A 2. This wall defined a space occupied by a paved floor, a
                                wide hearth and a couple of large interred <i>pithoi</i>. A third pithos,
                                provided with lid, was lying on another paved floor pertaining to a
                                second space of the same structure. </p>
                            <p> The last two phases investigated in Area A1 lie in the western
                                sector. Both are domestic contexts, very badly preserved because of
                                their proximity to the topsoil. In the north-western corner the
                                remains of a plastered floor are associated with an E-W mud brick
                                wall. To the north of these remains, two interconnected walls have
                                been unearthed, one of which is leaning above the filling of the
                                citadel wall spoil trench filling. </p>
                            <p> Operation B, located on the top of the mound, was also enlarged in
                                two directions. A first enlargement to the north-west, (Area B2)
                                aimed to extensively investigate the stone architecture that emerged
                                during the 2011 season. In particular we brought to light a new room
                                of the building exposed in 2011, together with a hall shaped as an
                                "8" lying to the south, found completely filled with stone debris.
                                Investigations on the floor sequence and their relations to the walls
                                finally allowed us to understand the different phases of structure
                                function. Already during the 2011 campaign we had noticed the
                                presence of both medieval and Hellenistic materials in the
                                accumulations above the floors of this architecture. Thanks to our
                                2012 work it is now clear that the structures extending to the north
                                of Op. B represent different phases of manipulation of a Hellenistic
                                building (Level 3), whose remains have been apparently reused also
                                during the Medieval Period (Levels 1-2). Some medieval installations
                                seem to have served for feeding and watering animals and seem to
                                reveal the rural nature of the settlement during that period. The
                                medieval masonry directly leans on coeval floors, without contacts to
                                the preceding floors, associated with the original Hellenistic
                                edition of the structure. </p>
                            <p> Area B1 is the southern elongation of the 2011 excavation area in
                                Operation B. In the northern sector of the area a series of medieval
                                layers have been brought to light, directly associated with the
                                northern levels. The uppermost level (Level 1) comprised a circular
                                stone structure with a diameter of 5m ca., recalling the typical
                                structures or fences nowadays used by local herdsmen. The
                                architecture found in the level underneath (Level 2) was quite poor,
                                comprising a house provided with very small rooms, barely preserved
                                clay floors and defined by single-lined stone walls.  Outside this
                                house, we found three broken storage jars, reused as trash bins or
                                ovens. </p>
                            <p> All traces of medieval occupation disappear in the levels below
                                (Level 3-4), giving way to badly eroded levels, disturbed by
                                activities of the preceding phases. Here the poor remains of a mud
                                brick wall have been found, whose relationships with other exposed
                                structures are very difficult to establish. The associated floors are
                                also poorly preserved and extant only in small portions. Judging from
                                stratigraphical sequence and ceramic findings, Levels 3 and 4 are to
                                be dated to the Hellenistic period. Below these levels, the
                                excavation was stopped after exposing the top of a large mud brick
                                wall running NW-SE, likely dating to the Iron Age. Significantly,
                                this mud brick wall runs parallel to a 1.50 m thick stone wall
                                uncovered immediately below the topsoil along the southern edge of
                                Area B1. However, this latter wall lies at a much higher elevation
                                then the mud brick wall, but it is cut by Hellenistic pits, leaving
                                the dating to the Iron Age as a possibility. </p>

                            <p> The 2013 excavation season, lasting from June to August, has
                                especially concerned the levels of Period III, dating to the
                                Achaemenid occupation of the site. Besides continuing the work
                                started in 2011 in the Operations A and B, in 2013 a new operation
                                (Operation D) was opened in the lower terrace of the site, along its
                                western borders. The joint investigation in the Operations A, B and D
                                unexpectedly revealed the relevance the site must have had during the
                                Achemenid period. In addition to the excavation, the first <a

                            <p> In the Area A1 of Operation A investigations have extended westwards.
                                The first level excavated in this area (Level A1.1) was lacking major
                                structures but, judging from the findings, including a small hoard of
                                13 bronze coins, can be dated to the Hellenistic period. Below the
                                Hellenistic level, we found a series of floors in relationship with
                                two badly preserved walls, forming the north-eastern corner of a
                                small space. The materials recovered from the floors and the
                                accumulations in between allow us to date their disposal to the
                                Achaemenid period, between the 6th and 4th century BC. The findings
                                in these levels of Area A1 are extraordinary in terms of both quality
                                and quantity. In fact, in addition to fine ceramic sherds, many of
                                which display painted decorations, we found a large amount of
                                terracottas, many zoomorphic and one anthropomorphic, representing a
                                female figure. Added to a fragment of architectural decoration, these
                                findings let us hypothesize that the levels constituted part of a
                                worship area of very high importance. </p>
                            <p> In the Area A2 of Operation A (squares 17.14-17.19-17.13-17.18), a
                                first level dating to the Hellenistic period (Level A2.1) has been
                                found, below which four levels dating to the Late Iron Age have been
                                excavated (A2.2-5). The first among these latter levels bore elements
                                of a workshop area, equipped with a furnace, half interred ovens,
                                working surfaces and rubbish pits with slags of various materials.
                                During the 2013 campaign we continued to expose the imposing E-W mud
                                brick wall unearthed in 2012, possibly dating to the 7th century.
                                Thus, works revealed this wall to be 13 m long, straddling squares
                                17.13 and 17.18. </p>

                            <p> Work in Operation B focused on its central area. Here, we first
                                investigated the medieval and Hellenistic levels (Levels B.1-4),
                                already partially exposed in 2011 and 2012. These levels,
                                particularly those dating to the Medieval Period (Levels B.1-2), were
                                characterized by a series of pits, several large (reaching 3 m in
                                diameter), cutting the preceding levels of occupation. This pitting
                                heavily hindered the possibility to fully understand stratigraphical
                                relationships between the different levels. The south-western sector
                                of Operation B was better preserved compared to the central sector.
                                In particular, we brought to light stone structures and floors
                                associated with a Hellenistic house reused and modified in the
                                Medieval Period. The southern half of square 16.16 was entirely
                                occupied by structures of a monumental building, whose main element
                                was a massive 1m thick and 10m long mud brick wall. This wall,
                                oriented SE-NW, formed at its eastern ending a corner with a NW-SE
                                wall, preserving traces of a white plastering. In this corner we
                                opened a deep sounding that, while not yet reaching the original
                                floor of the room, revealed the walls to be preserved for the
                                extraordinary elevation of more than 2m. The deep sounding, moreover,
                                reached several intermediate floor levels, indicating multiple stages
                                of reutilization of the large structure after its first installation
                                (Levels B.5-7). The accumulations and the debris leaning against the
                                wall and filling the large room produced ceramic materials dating to
                                the Achaemenid period. Moreover, in the bottom of the sounding a
                                circular mud brick installation forming a quarter of circle joined to
                                the two perpendicular walls has been found. In the filling of this
                                installation, probably a trash bin, two complete ceramic bowls have
                                been found, both pertaining to a Late Iron Age horizon. </p>

                            <p> The new Operation opened in 2013 (Operation D) occupies the western
                                limit of the lower terrace of Kınık Höyük (square 1.15). The latest
                                level delineated here, lying a few centimeters below the topsoil, was
                                heavily disturbed and dates to the Medieval Period. This level (Level
                                D.1) displayed very different features from those of the medieval
                                settlement in Operation B, and some findings suggest an earlier
                                dating to the Byzantine period. If confirmed, this hypothesis would
                                attest the presence at Kınık of a Byzantine settlement limited to the
                                lower town and not involving the mound itself. In the north-eastern
                                corner of Operation D, we found a small space, demarcated by stone
                                walls. It is likely attributable to a Hellenistic level (Level D.2),
                                judging from the materials produced by the fillings. Investigations
                                south-west of this room suggest that it could have been associated to
                                some craft production activities. Below the Hellenistic level we
                                unearthed a small space (Level D.3), defined by two mud brick walls
                                and a small stone wall, maybe pertaining to an earlier phase. Judging
                                from the hardness of the mud bricks, possibly produced as an effect
                                of burning, the presence of many ash accumulations and the recovery
                                of oven remains, this was an industrial area, maybe for the
                                processing of foodstuffs or even of metals, as apparently suggested
                                by some slags retrieved in the surroundings. Ceramic materials,
                                including a fragment of a painted lekythos, provide a dating of Level
                                D.3 to the Achemenid period. </p>
                            <p> In 2013 the restoration work for the outer facade of the citadel wall
                                has started. Functional to the restoration work, we carried out
                                archaeological excavation in the area, which brought to light the
                                construction phase of the wall itself, corresponding to the most
                                ancient level so far reached at Kınık (Level A.8). Moreover, the
                                excavation to better expose the facade led to the reconnaissance of a
                                rampart, covering the most ancient construction phase of the wall and
                                associated to the most recent one. </p>

                            <p> The 2014 season, lasting from mid-July to early September, continued to produce new and exciting results for the seven levels of occupation already identified at Kınık Höyük during the previous three campaigns. The 2014 excavation comprised three areas of operation. Operation A on the northwestern slope of the mound included sector A1 in the southwest, sector A2 in the southeast and sector A-Walls in the deposits north of the citadel walls. Operation B continued excavation at the top of the mound and Operation D continued excavation on the terrace in the western sector of the lower town. </p>

                            <p> <strong>Operation A1</strong> <br>
In sector A1 the excavation was extended toward the south (S17.3) in order to further investigate the Levels A1.1-2, which represent the Hellenistic and Achaemenid Period occupations that were first uncovered in 2013. Level A1.1 consists of a terraced platform defined to the north by a mudbrick wall A104 and to the east by a stone wall A126. The terrace likely represented a court with a storage function, with at least three phases of use. Five big <i>pithoi</i> were placed into the soil of the court. East of the stone wall a space defined by a floor may have functioned as a partially roofed room as indicated by its many postholes and a central fireplace. This space also included a bench or chest constructed of stones and filled with earth and a hoard of 17 bronze coins which were sealed from above with mudbricks. They most likely belong to the same hoard as thirteen coins discovered in 2013. The area around the bench yielded two more hoards under the floor, and sparse coins for a total of 189. Readable coins date to the late 2nd – early 1st century BCE.  On the floor below, belonging to Level A1.2, a red painted base of a terracotta statuette was found: its production technique, fabric and decoration are compatible with the two bases of zoomorphic vessels found in 2013 likely dating to the Late Achaemenid Period.</p>
                            <p> <strong>Operation A2</strong> <br> 
Work in Sector A2 continued to investigate the buildings associated with Level A2.3, the LIA I (Period IV; 7th-6th c. BCE) that were uncovered in the previous two campaigns. Our excavation extended southward (S17.18) and removed floor A282, revealing its preparation layers below and another floor A1215 which could also be dated to the LIA I due to the well preserved collection of ceramics found in the ashy layer just above the floor. This floor, also associated with mudbrick walls A234 and A300, defines a large court (Room 1) that represented an earlier phase A2.4b. The northern wall of the court was constructed against the internal red-painted plastering of the citadel walls and was coated with many layers of fine, white-painted plaster, traces of which were also identified on the western wall A234. The walls delimitating the court show multiple phases of construction, possibly due to earthquakes or the instability of the area. The court was accessed from a large passageway on the southwestern corner that preserved part of a nicely smoothed, regularly set basalt stone pavement. Three floors in the court were exposed, all with very few materials, dating to the LIA I and MIA. The discovery of fragments of at least three <i>pithoi</i> on the floor A1222 = A1245 suggests that the court played a part in storage for this building.</p>

                            <p> <strong>Operation A-Walls</strong> <br>
In 2014 we exposed five more meters of the citadel walls in S17.19, east of the section exposed during the previous three campaigns.  Three rows of a mudbrick superstructure were revealed at the easternmost edge of this section once again indicating the excellent preservation of this monument.  Furthermore, we were able to excavate and date the seven levels of outer archaeological deposits abutting the walls on the northern slope of the mound (A.1-7).  Level A.3 is most likely the latest level in which the walls were still in use and dates to the LIA II/Achaemenid Period from initial potter analysis.  A 30 cm channel, possibly representing the remains of a drainage system, ran along the outer face of the walls during this period.  The level below, A.4, used a different type of drainage system consisting of yellow permeable earth brought to the settlement.  Level A.5 included an interesting feature made from mud and stones formed a 1 m thick installation which was covered by a 1.5 thick accumulation rich with bones and ceramics dating to the MIA. Level A.6 dates to the EIA and the accumulations here may represent trash deposits moved here to help protect the stone socle of the walls from outside attack and provide stabilization to the walls which were in need of repair already during this period.  Finally, A.7 is the level in which the walls were constructed.  C14 analysis of timber used in the outer face of the stone socle provides a date of 1400+/-50 BCE and the ceramics in the rampart accumulation A161 provide a date of the LBA-EIA.  To the north, an earlier phase of construction was uncovered. A stone rectangular foundation with traces of a mudbrick superstructure jutted out from the walls and may belong to a tower. This level is not yet dateable. </p>

                            <p> <strong>Operation B</strong> <br>
The main aim of the 2014 season was to further investigate the Achaemenid Period mudbrick building which witnessed several phases (Levels B5-7). Mudbrick walls B397 and B673, first exposed in 2013, are common features for all three levels. These walls are particularly well preserved, ca. 2 m high and 1 m wide, with some spots displaying a robust colored plastering. The latest phase of this structure, is also defined by two additional walls (B815 and B892), which join with B397 and B673 to form a large trapezoidal room measuring ca. 10 m by 3-4 m (Room 7). Below, in Level B6, the main architectural feature of this room is the wall B897. This wall, comprising a stone socle and mudbrick superstructure, runs NW-SE just below the later wall B892 and is coated by a thick layer of plaster. The earliest floor of Level B.6 (phase <i>b</i>), was provided with an oven (B2001), equipped with a lateral stone installation. Toward the north-western corner of the room the bottom of a mill was found upside down on the floor. The presence of a mill, oven, and several ashy fireplaces indicate that this space was associated with food preparation during Level B6. Level B7 is currently exposed only in the eastern half of Room 7 and will be investigated in 2015. </p>

                            <p> <strong>Operation D</strong> <br>
In 2014, we continued to excavate in several areas of S1.15 in order to bring the entire area to a uniform level and to better articulate the changes between the Hellenistic Level D2 and Achaemenid Level D3 periods and to begin to investigate evidence for a LIA I (Period IV) occupation.  The transitional phase between the Achaemenid and Hellinstic periods (Level D2.b) was preserved and investigated east of stone wall D1114 which defines a room (Room 2) first uncovered in 2013. Here we excavated a series of accumulations full of thick ash and charcoal fragments and poorly preserved floors.  Similar to documented activity on the citadel, this phase indicates the burning and removal of previous floors in preparation of the floors and architecture associated with Level D2.a which definitively dates to the Hellenistic Period. We continued excavating east of Room 2 (Level D3.a) and revealed food production installations including large (D1161) and small (D1191) domed mudbrick ovens as well Olynthus type basalt mill, consisting of a hopper and lower curved grinding stone, (which is compatible with a 5th century BCE dating for Level D.3a. The Level D.3b directly below also corresponds to the Achaemenid Period.  Excavation inside Room 2 revealed another food processing area and a deeper sounding below the Achaemenid floors in the southern portion of the room suggests we have reached a LIA I occupation. </p>
                            <p> <strong>Conservation</strong> <br>
Conserving the citadel walls and protecting the site for future excavation and visitors is an important aspect of our project at Kınık Höyük. In 2014 we were able to confirm that the mortar-like material (natural volcanic binder and MAPEI mixed with soil and water) used to stabilize the masonry was a success.  In order to further protect the walls, and most importantly, their well-preserved outer mud plastering, we began a roofing project to replace a previous temporary roof. A system of multiple roofs at different heights covering different contiguous areas of the excavation was conceived in order to be able to take apart single elements without disassembling the whole roofing system.  In Operation B, the conservation team also took samples of the painted plaster from the Achaemenid building and another roof was constructed to protect this area of the site.  Finally, the summer of 2014 witnessed the construction of temporary trails and the erection of information panels in Turkish, Italian and English which have already benefitted locals and visitors alike. </p>

                            <h3>2015</h3>
                            <p>The 2015 campaign at Kınık Höyük lasted the two months of June and July and saw the participation of 30 specialists and students (archaeologists, topographers, restorers, illustrators, geologists), and 24 workers. The main goals were: the investigation of the pre-classical levels of the sacred area of the citadel, in operation A, sector A1; the extensive excavation of the summit of the citadel to expose the plan of the well-preserved ‘yellow building’ (a building made of a yellowish mud-brick dating to the Achaemenid period); the investigation of a new portion of the citadel walls on the southern slopes of the mound; and the deep trench sounding of the occupational history of the lower town of the site.</p>
                            <p>The fifth year is a bench mark for all ventures, and even more for the project Kınık Höyük. It was the right time to start planning the publication of the first final report volume on the Hellenistic occupation on the site; therefore, a group of scholars participated in the excavation to plan this volume and start analyzing the materials for the scope. Maria Elena Gorrini (Ass. Prof. of Classical Archaeology, Pavia University), worked in our new storehouse on the collection of terracotta figurines, finding growing evidence of the import of some of them from Tarsus, in Cilicia. Together with Maria Elena, ISAW PhD student Irene Soto started to work on the ceramic typology of the Hellenistic period; this is an important step, since it will be the first such a work for the entire Hellenistic kingdom of Cappadocia. For a week, Kathryn Morgan (PhD student, UPenn) joined the mission to study the rich collection of textile production tools from the citadel and the lower town of Kınık. Through the work of these three experts, and the contribution of the field directors, the character of the Hellenistic town hidden under the surface of Kınık Höyük became every day more tangible.</p>
                            <p>The emphasis on the Hellenistic period dictated the strategy for the excavations in Operation B on the summit of the mound. This year we continued to excavate the rests of the small private houses of Level B4, built on top of an artificial terrace. The terrace was obtained by cutting the wall remains of the imposing building of the earlier level B5-7 and filling the empty rooms mainly with trash layers of ashes and various organic and ceramic remains. In a niche on a wall of one of the Hellenistic mud-brick rooms, we found a large vessel, possibly connected with wine drinking in ritual context. At the end of the campaign, the results of the excavations provided a novel and quite unusual spatial organization of the citadel during the 3rd-early 1st c. BCE. In this period, the top of the mound was likely encircled by a 1m thick defensive wall; houses and other buildings developed along this wall, while the concave core of the citadel was almost empty and eventually used as a large dumping area. Since so little is known about the plan of the town centers in Central Anatolia during the Hellenistic period, and classical authors claimed that even with a large number of inhabitants most of them could not be named <i>poleis,</i> this discovery provides us with the first new evidence about how these Anatolian Hellenistic towns were structured.</p>
                            <p>The investigation of the pre-classical occupation is central to the research at Kınık Höyük. The landscape monuments of the “forgotten kingdom” of Tuwana, a Neo-Hittite polity archaeologically still unexplored, date to this period. Excavation of the pre-classical levels continued on the southern slope of the mound and in the lower town. While Nancy Highcock and Erkan Akbulut (resp. PhD and MA student, ANEES-NYU) uncovered several phases of use of private dwelling with facilities for the production and process of food, but also fine ceramics, and eventually reached the levels dating to the 7th-6th century BCE (KH-Period IV), Dr. Anna Lanaro (affiliated researcher, ISAW-NYU), Lorenzo Castellano (PhD student, ISAW-NYU), Marco De Pietri (Pavia University), and Phillip Strosahl (ANEESNYU) reopened operation C, investigating the citadel walls. Mr. Castellano excavated a small sounding trench inside walls, attempting to reach and explore the Bronze Age occupation in the citadel. The structure he found, the western wall of a huge pit coated with vegetal, possibly straw remains, came as a surprise, reminiscent of the huge underground siloi of the Hittite sites, like those uncovered at <i>Sarissa</i> Kuşaklı.</p>
                            <p>The team led by Dr. Lanaro was asked to investigate extensively the citadel walls on the southern slopes of the mound, after a 30m-long portion of this wall had been exposed on the northern slopes during the first four campaigns. Our aim was to check the technique, the state of preservation, and the dating of the walls in this area of the site. Dr. Lanaro and her team were able to expose some 40m of the stone socle of the perfectly preserved citadel fortification, as well as an imposing 6 x 6 meter tower protruding from the walls. A trench cut into the wall’s masonry showed that this portion of the wall was not executed with the same technique as the one exposed to the north and that reparations and adjustments were multiple, both on its inner and outer faces. One of these phases had a post quem dating provided by the finding of beautiful “Alışar IV ceramic” fragments with the typical deer represented in a silhouette style. The presence of this excellent production is one more clue about the importance of the site in the early first millennium BCE.</p>
                            <p>The state of preservation of these portions of the walls is another exception for pre-classical Anatolia, such that our aim is to prepare them for restoration and opening to the public. For this mission, two restorers from the faculty of engineering at Pavia University joined our team and created new experimental movable roofs which will serve as provisional covering for the excavation areas. The roofs are designed to have a low impact in terms of weight (thus the use of wood and tin) and to be quickly assembled and removed in modules. Besides the roofing, restorers also tested new stabilization materials on the mudbrick and the mud plastering unearthed on the citadel.</p>
                            <p>The ancient landscape around the site and the environmental change in the past 10,000 years are also an important part of our research agenda. This year, in cooperation with a team of geologists from CNRS, France, and the University of Niğde, we  facilitated and analyzed the results of the coring in different spots of the Plain of Bor. Our primary result was the discovery of an ancient lake and marshy area in the first half of the 2nd millennium BCE. Previous investigations in the neighboring Konya plain found that the whole Southern Anatolian Plateau was a unique lake basin during the Pleistocene, but that no later extensive water areas ever existed. The presence of a lake in the center of the Bor Plain provides a completely new interpretation of the settlement pattern in the region and hints at the importance of the site as an obligate passage between the mountains and the lakeshore. One of this is Kınık Höyük.</p>

                                <p>Operation A1, Sacred Area: Sanctuary of the Hellenistic  Period (Level 1)</p>
                            </div>
                            <p>The excavations led by Andrea Trameri (PhD Student, ISAW-NYU) in the sacred area of sector A1 on the north-western edge of the citadel (S17.3-4-9.) reached the Achaemenid Level 2 in 2015. The aim of the campaign was to investigate the construction history of a storage platform with interred big pithoi, dated to the Hellenistic period, and to excavate a series of ashy deposits rich in animal bones located in a room belonging to Level 2. These deposits, interpreted as discard deposits from cultic activities, were rich in interesting materials, particularly zoomorphic vessels representing birds and terracotta animal figurines.</p>
                            <p>LEVEL 2. The Hellenistic storage terrace has been entirely excavated, exposing structures from the earlier Level (Lv. 2) that show a different function. In the Achaemenid period, 1 m wide walls with a stone socle and mud-brick superstructure were built on this area. To the north and the east, these walls were severely damaged due to later reconstructions or to the erosion along the mound slopes.</p>
                            <p>While the spaces to the south and north-west have not been excavated, a single room, partially exposed in the S-W corner of the excavation area, is defined to the east by a long mud brick wall (1687), preserved for an height of ca. 1.5 m. The wall was cut in Hellenistic time and obliterated by a stone wall with similar orientation used as the east limit of the later platform (see below). Also the north wall (1664) had been only partially preserved due to a cut possibly to install big storage vessels during the re-functionalization of the whole area in Level 1. A floor in phase with the walls yield painted sherds dating prior to the 2nd c. BCE (e.g. 1690.1), and the mixed material found in the deposits above the floor are also attributed to the same period. </p>
                            <p>North of the wall, a second room was uncovered and partially excavated. It is characterized, unlike the room to the south, by deposits with huge quantities of animal bones, ashes, burnt materials, and strongly sloping to the west. These layers were excavated ca. 1.5 m below the elevation of the Hellenistic terrace. The excavation confirms the nature of the deposits already defined in 2013, characterized by the following features: a large quantity of animal bones that palaeozoological investigations proved to be 2-4 years old sheep-goat, fragments of statuines, fragments of fine ceramic bowls, and fragments of several big zoomorphic vessels or terracotta figurines mainly representing birds and bulls (often red painted and polished). The latter are stylistically pre-Hellenistic, some possibly dating back to the Iron Age. Particularly noteworthy for 2015 was the finding of several terracotta figurines (at least 9, excluding minor fragments) representing bovines, especially bulls. Fragments of a splendid, very carefully polished ceramic rhyton representing a caprid (deer/ibex? F16) were found in the same context. The rhyton is likely dating to the Achaemenid period, and goes along with similar exemplars produced in metal. All these deposits likely indicate a later, secondary function of the whole northern room, used as a sort of favissa to deposit within the sacred area the remains of cultic activities performed in a sanctuary. Two 14C samples from the deposits give 95.4% 2 sigma ante quem calibrate dates resp. 391-209 BCE, and 360-157 BCE. It seems therefore likely that the final date of Level 2 in the sacred area lays somewhere between the end of the 4th and the 3rd c. BCE.</p>
                            <p>LEVEL 1. The Hellenistic period level is subdivided in five well-recognized phases. Initially, the southern room of Level 2 was filled and new floors were re-constructed (phase 1e-d) with a new storage platform, defined to the east by a new stone wall (126). The latter was built directly over the earlier mud brick structures. A low east-west oriented mud brick wall (1623) served as northern limit of the storage platform that served as part of the facilities of the Hellenistic sanctuary.</p>
                            <p>In these first phases, we suggest that also the area east of the stone wall was a lower storage platform with interred pithoi. No one single pithos was found there, but several circular pits found in 2014, all of the same dimensions, may correspond to the empty space once accommodating the pithoi. In later phases (phase 1c-b), the whole area was redefined by the further elevation of the platform west of the stone-wall 126, by a cut in the ashy accumulations deposits and the masonry of Level 2, and by the construction of a second mud brick wall (104), whose circular plans follows the mound shape. Together with the walls, new pithoi, perhaps systematically removed from the area to the east, were installed on the terrace. Over the eastern storage platform a room was built with a well-executed, circular fireplace in the center of the floor (1534). This room may be dated to the mid-2nd – mid-1st c. BCE, and may have served as an important space within the sanctuary, on the basis of having found rich bronze coin hoards (circa 200 coins), and other materials here in the 2014 campaign.</p>

                            <p>During the 2015 campaign, the excavation of the accumulations and floors that constitute the terrace, produced a Late Hellenistic ceramic assemblage of very fine wares, not only of high quality local products but also of numerous imports (e.g. F14). The quantity of metal objects was also particularly rich, such as a fully-preserved copper or bronze ladle (F10), a short iron knife (F33), and two silver zoomorphic feet (possibly representing, once again, the paws of a bird of prey), belonging originally to an unidentified vessel, possibly a cista or a mensula. All these objects, as well as 40 coins of the hoards excavated in 2013 and 2014, were restored this year. After restoration it was possible to date the coins between the second half of the 2nd and the mid 1st  century BCE. They came not only from the centers of the kingdom of Cappadocia, such as Eusebeya-Mazaka (Caesareia-Kayseri), Eusebeya-Tyana (today’s Kemerhisar, Niğde), but also from neighboring regions such as Ikonium (Konya), Tarsus, Aigiai (Cilicia), and far regions as the Seleucid kingdom.</p>

                            <h3>2016</h3>
                            <p>Excavations were organized in five operations. In Operation A1 the team continued the investigation of the cultic area. After completing the investigation of the Late Hellenistic sanctuary in 2015, the 2016 campaign brought to light four rooms belonging to the sanctuary of the previous occupation period (Achaemenid - early Hellenistic). A trench in room Ar3 exposed the eastern portion of the room, allowing for the excavation of two floors belonging to the sanctuary, as well as the fill between. From this room fill, two whole votive terracotta statuettes of bovids emerged, as well as and a stone statuette of a falcon displaying preserved black painted decoration. Additional finds such as censers and fine black and red-banded ceramics, indicate that the room Ar3 context of the sanctuary is particularly well preserved and promising for next year investigations.</p>
                            <p>In order to extend the investigation of the sacred area, a new Operation (E) has been opened south of Operation A1. The extension has allowed us to bring to light a stone-lined mud-brick wall with a width of ca 5 feet (1.5 m). The wall definitely belongs to the building of the Early Hellenistic sanctuary, identified in the adjacent Operation A1. To the east of the wall the presence of a medium-sized pebbles paving suggests the presence of a large courtyard.</p>
                            <p>The team also continued the investigations of the citadel with particular focus on its the southern region. Operation B has uncovered a small domestic quarter of the town dating to the early Hellenistic period, while in Operation C continued the investigation of the stratigraphy of the late Iron Age. In c. the VII-VI BC, the occupation was not limited to the fortified citadel, but also extended to the lower town, as the excavations carried out in Operation D established.</p>
                            <p>The 2016 restoration work included our collection of ca. 200 bronze Hellenistic coins, the metal objects discovered in previous campaigns, and the Hawk statuette (see. above). Architectural restoration tests were carried out on the plaster of the city walls. Removable wooden roofs were constructed to cover the trenches in the southern region of the site, which is less exposed to strong winds; the northern areas were instead covered with geotextile and / or nylon.</p>
                            <p>In the next campaign it is expected that we will complete the excavation of the Achaemenid sanctuary and to get down to the levels of Iron Age throughout the entirety of Operation A; at the same time we intend to continue the extensive excavation of the Hellenistic shrine in the courtyard E. The excavations will also continue in Operation B to highlight the monumental building of the Achaemenid age, Operation C in order to reach the levels of the late Bronze Age, and in Operation D to continue exposing the stratigraphy of the settlement below the citadel. In the laboratory we will proceed with the restoration of ceramic artifacts found in recent years, while in the field we will continue the agenda of testing and consolidation of the architecture.</p>
                            <p>Finally, in 2017 we expect to publish the first definitive volume of excavations in Kınık on the Hellenistic period.</p>

                <h3>2011</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The first campaign of excavations at Kınık Höyük started in late August 2011. Three operations were opened, labelled A, B and C, following the results of <strong><a href="geophysic.html">the geophisical survey performed in 2010.</a></strong> 
                    In particular, Operations A and C investigated the citadel walls, respectively on the northern and south-western slopes of the mound, while Operation B was opened on the top of the mound, aiming to investigate extensively the large stone structure indicated by the GPR.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2011, Operation B consisted of three squares of 10x10 meters, forming a rectangle oriented north-south measuring 10x30m in total. The 2011 year of excavation uncovered two levels corresponding to the most recent period of the site’s occupation. Both are characterized by a stone architecture.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first level is represented just by a room found on the eastern edge of the central square. Few materials were found on the soil associated with this room though, because the soil is so close to the surface its dating is skeptical.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second level consists of remains of domestic architecture and an open working area. It is constructed of two-row walls, which are 70-90 cm. thick and preserved for a height of about 50 cm. They are quite irregular, and use unshaped stones bound with clay mortar. In the norther square, the stone walls defining two rooms of a building are easily discernible; the eastern room with a surface of nine square meters has been entirely excavated. This room was found filled by debris of stone walls, under which lies a hard clay floor. In the northern part of the eastern wall a doorway opens toward an alley oriented north-south, dividing this building from another one, whose eastern wall run almost parallel to the eastern edge of the excavated area. On this alley beside the doorway a <em>tandır</em>
                    associated to the building was found. A second opening can be seen in the southeastern corner of the room, likely caused, in this case, by later spoliation of the wall. Here and elsewhere the architecture is cut by several modern pits: these occasionally caused difficulties in the collection of homogeneus assemblages of materials. The central sector of Operation B is characterized by retaining walls and installations, whose function are difficult to understand. South of these structures a semicircular area has a preserved hard clay soil covered by an accumulation of reddish and grayish ash. Within the ash, various slags were found, which hint at small scale working activity. To the south poorer architectural remains have been found. Here, allignments of stones and pieces of wall possibly formed a small building complex associated to a court with a central pithos.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ceramics found in level B2 can be dated to the medieval period. The dating is supported by the comparison with the excavations of the medieval levels at nearby excavations of Tyana Kemerhisar, and we owe this information to a strong cooperation between the two missions. However, assemblages are never homogeneus and Hellenistic sherds are found in most of Operation B’s stratigraphic units, thus hinting at the presence of a Hellenistic level underneath.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beside the operation on the top of the mound, two operations were opened on the slopes of the mound, labelled A and C.
                </p>
                <div class="thumbnail col-sm-5">
                    <a href="foto/excavation/necklace-from-op-a.png">
                        <img src="foto/excavation/necklace-from-op-a.png" alt=""></a>
                    <p>caption</p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Operation A was opened on the northern side just above the edge of a huge pit used in modern times as a stone quarry for building materials. Since the geomagnetic survey did not show the presence of citadel walls in this area, we assume that they had been removed while digging in the quarry. Thus the goal of this operation was to obtain a stratigraphic window into the earliest stratigraphy of the mound. After removing the topsoil, an accumulation of repositioned mud-bricks was reached. In this accumulation a pit was cut, which accommodated a simple east-west oriented burial in very poor condition. However, beside the death, grave goods were found and consisted of a necklace made of glass beads of different colors, sizes and shapes, placed inside of a ceramic vessel. The variety of glass beads are all rod-shaped (Harden 1981) and decorated with color applied bands or pellets. Apart from some eye beads, whose production is already well attested in the second millennium BC, most of them find good parallels in productions ranging from the Middle Iron Age down to the first century BC.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The necklace is therefore a good <em>terminus ante quem</em>
                    for the stratigraphy underneath.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Under the thick accumulation of repositioned mud-bricks, stone masonry belonging to the citadel’s fortification wall was found. This massive east-west structure is over four meters wide. Upon this discovery our strategy changed, and a two meter wide sounding perpendicular to the outer face of the citadel wall was opened in order to investigate the slope’s stratigraphy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the end of the campaign more than five meters of the outer face of the wall were exposed, and the foundations of the walls were not yet reached. Two main phases of this wall were identified. The later phase is built with a “Schalenmauer” technique: inner and outer faces are made of larger unshaped stones, whereas the stones in the center of the wall are smaller, rarely exceeding a diameter of about thirty to thirty-five centimeters. A clay mortar was used to stabilize the structure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the outer face of the wall a ten centimeter thick layer of mud plastering with vegetal inclusions was preserved. The adherence of this coating to the stone face of the walls was possibly implemented by small wooden logs, organized in six irregular horizontal rows. These wooden elements would have protruded from the wall’s surface in the plastering. This reconstruction is based on the presence of wood remnants in the log holes, which are still preserved in the plaster.
                </p>
                <p>
                    About three meters under the top of the wall a slanting clay rampart associated with the wall plaster, which make clear the outer soil that associated with the first phase. Similar wall plastering has been detected elsewhere in fortifications walls of pre-classical Anatolia, but the example from Kınık Höyük is noteworthy, because of its exceptional state of preservation. Under this rampart two more meters of stone masonry were exposed. Those, however, are made of slightly smoothed blocks with diameters of about 50-60 centimeters, and are not covered by plastering. The profile shows that an edge of this earlier phase projects for about 1.30 meters beyond the wall face of the later phase. The eastern face of a second north-south wall was exposed in the western section of the sounding. This wall works with the earlier phase of the citadel walls, and shares with it the (large) dimensions and the working of the face blocks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The citadel walls were also investigated in operation C, on the southwestern slope of the mound. In order to keep the walls in the best state of preservation, in view of its stabilization, four soundings were opened instead of one extensive excavation area. In each sounding a similar situation emerged: uphill levels, which abut or work with the citadel stone walls; the citadel walls, covering the central part of the soundings; and finally, the downhill levels, which abut on the outer face of the wall. The wall’s building technique and dimensions are the same as those of the walls excavated in operation A, and the dimensions and the smoothing of the blocks on the outer face possibly indicate that they belong to the earlier phase attested to A. Since the downhill levels were investigated in operation A, investigations in C were mainly concentrated on the uphill levels in order to understand the relationship between the wall and the stratigraphy of the inner citadel.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Uphill stratigraphy in all of the soundings present a series of one to three clay soils. In soundings 1, 2 and 4 the doors were associated with mudbrick or stone architecture remains. The ceramic repertoire of the different soils is quite homogenous and can be primarily dated to the Middle to Late Iron Age. A large number of the ceramic sherds consist of blackon- white and black-on-red painted pottery with geometric patterns, such as zig-zag lines, triangles, crosses and patterns composed of bows, parallel dashes and wavy lines. The finest piece of pottery found in Operation C, belonging to sounding 4, is a fragment of a carinated cup with an applied deer motif.  Very peculiar for this sherd is the technique: it is not the normal painted ware, but figures were shaped, moulded or even possibly cut out, applied to the cup and then painted. The deer motif represented in a clear silhouette style is strongly reminiscent of the silhouette deer iconography on the Alishar IV production, well known from many sites of Central Anatolia, from Alishar to Bogazköy and, closer to Kınık Höyük, Porsuk and Kamankale Höyük.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In sounding 3 a thick layer of collapsed mudbrick was partially covering the upper section of the citadel wall and collasped inward. The context indicates that these mudbricks belonged to the walls, constituting their superstructure. Since the mudbrick debris was sealed by three soils with IA sherds
                    <em>in situ</em>
                    , a dating of the walls phase excavated in operation C before the Middle to Late Iron Age is assured. The dating of the walls in Operation A are still up for debate, but are coherent with the results achieved in C. Pottery sherds found in the accumulation above the walls, as well as in the accumulations abutting the outer face of the walls, are not homogeneus in dating, but no diagnostics dating prior to the LIA have been uncovered. All of this indicates that both phases can date prior to the LIA. Even though using different materials, the parallels drawn with the walls of the neighboring sites of Porsuk and Alishar could offer further information for dating the later phases- in the least for the Middle Iron age.

                <h3>2012</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The second excavation season at Kınık Höyük started on June the 1st and closed on July the 30th 2012. Works have focused on two Operations, A and B, in both cases extending the excavation of 2011. During the 2011 season, in Op. A we had exposed the monumental citadel walls. In 2012 the excavation area has been enlarged in two directions, west and south. Towards the west (Area A1), the aim was to expose the continuation of the citadel wall, while the enlargement towards the south was indended to investigate the inner structures of the citadel (Area A2), clarifying their stratigraphical and planimetric relationships with the wall.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In area A1, under the top soil, we unearthed a series of 4 levels, all dating to the Late Iron Age. The first level is occupied by a productive area, presenting two phases. The first (Level 1) comprises a floor pierced by a series of pits, of which two contained ashes and other traces of burnt. A small olla for firing perfectly preserved was unearthed in this phase, together with various ceramic and glass slags. Underneath this phase, the second phase comprised a clay floor, associated to a series of pits and to a small half-interred mud brick oven. A complete red burnished plate was found within the oven.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second Late Iron Age level (Level 2) is comprised by a small stone wall running E-W, to which a lamination of several clay floors are associated, many patched by ash spots. This level is well preserved only in the north-eastern sector of the excavated area, while to the south-west it is badly eroded and cut by the Level 1 pits.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Underneath Level 2, a seriation of several other floors, apparently not associated with any structure, represents another level (Level 3). Significantly, in these floor and in the above lying accumulations a rich assemblage of ceramic sherds was recovered, among which there were also fragments of a pitcher with polychrome flowerlike.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The fourth Late Iron Age level (Level 4) is characterized by a well made architecture. This comprises a mud brick wall with stone socle running N-S, perpendicularly to the citadel wall. To the north it forms a corner with another mud brick wall running E, which breaks up after ca. 1 m, perhaps in connection to a sort of passage or doorway for the building. Both the N-S and the W-E wall are plastered, maybe even painted as traces on the former seem to reveal. The room defined by the two walls has not been excavated yet, but the mud brick debris sealing it have been completely exposed. To the south the room is defined by a second W-E. Here the area is quite disturbed by pits dug from the above lying levels, but it has been possible to expose a third W-E wall. It probably defined another room, the western sector of which preserves a well made floor, paved with large stones.

                    Area A1, is the western extension the 2011 excavations in Operation A, where the imposing structure of the citadel wall was exposed for 4.5 m in width and 6m in height. On the northern facade of the wall, the sole exposed so far, a perfectly preserved 10 cm thick layer of plaster was found. In 2012 we opened a 12x10 m excavation area following westwards the orientation of the wall. At the end of the works in the area, we discovered that, after its dismissal, the citadel wall was heavily spoiled along its whole thickness, in order to obtain building materials ready to be used for other structure. Only the southern limit of the wall remained untouched by spoiling activities. Just above these meager remains of the citadel wall runs a mud brick wall with stone socle, joining with the Level 4 structures emerged in the Area A 2. This wall defines a space occupied by a paved floor, a wide hearth and a couple of large interred pithoi. A third pithos, provided with lid, was lying on another paved floor pertaining to a second space of the same structure.

                    The last two phases investigated in Area A1 lie in the western sector. Both are occupied by domestic contexts, very badly preserved because of their proximity to the top soil. In the north-western corner the remains of a platered floor are associated to an E-W mud brick wall. To the north of these remains, two interconnected walls have been unearthed, one of which leaning above the filling of the citadel wall spoil trench filling.

                    Also Operation B, located on the top of the mound, has been enlarged in two directions. A first enlargement to the north-west, (Area B2) was aimed to extensively investigate the stone architecture emerged during the 2011 season. In particular a new room of the building exposed in 2011 has been brought to light, together with an 8-shaped hall lying to the south, completely filled with stone debris, now removed. Investigations on the floor sequences and their relations to the walls finally allowed the understanding the different phases of utilization of the structures. Already during the 2011 campaign we had noticed the presence of both Medieval and Hellenistic materials in the accumulations above the floors of this architecture. Thanks to 2012 work it is now clear that the structures extending to the north of Op. B represent different phases of manipulation of a Hellenistic building, whose remains have been apparently reused also during the Middle Age. Some Medieval installations seem to have served for feeding and watering animals and  seem to reveal the rural nature of the settlement during that period. The Medieval masonry directly leans on coeval floors, without contacts with preceeding floors, associated to the Hellenistic originary edition of the structure.

                <p>
                    Area B1 is the southern elongation of the 2011 excavation area in Operation B. In the northern sector of the area a series of Medieval layers have been brought to light, directly associated to the northern levels. The uppermost level comprises a circular stone structure with a diameter of 5m ca., recalling the typical structures or fences nowadays used in the yaylas. The architecture found in the levels underneath is quite poor, comprising a house provided with very small rooms, poorly preserved clay floors and defined by bare single-lined stone walls. Out of this house, three storage jars have been found, used for storing foodstuffs or water.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Two levels underneath any trace of Medieval occupation disappear, leaving place to badly eroded levels, disturbed by activities of preceeding phases. Here the poor remains of a mud brick wall have been found, whose relationships with other structures so far exposed are very difficult to establish. Also the associated floors are are badly preserved only in small portions. Judging from the findings, these phases are to be dated to the transition between the Hellenistic period and the Late Iron Age. Below these levels, the excavation has stopped after exposing the top of a large mud brick wall running NW-SE, likely dating to the Iron Age. Significantly, this mud brick wall runs parallel to a 1.50 m thick stone wall uncovered immediately below the top soil along the southern edge of Area B1. This latter wall lies however at a much higher elevation then the mud brick wall, but it is cut by Hellenistic pits, leaving the dating to the Iron Age as a possibility.

                    The 2013 excavation season has especially concerned the levels of Period III, dating to the Achemenid occupation of the site. Beside continuing the work started in 2011 in the Operations A and B, in 2013 a new operation (Operation D) was opened in the lower terrace of the site, along its western borders. The joint investigation in the Operations A, B and D unexpectedly revealed the relevance the site must have had during the Achemenid period. In addition to the excavation, the first <strong><a href="preservation.html">restoration and preservation works</a></strong> 
                    have been carried out, focusing on the citadel wall exposed in Op. A during the 2011 and 2012 campaings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the Area A1 of Op. A investigations have extended westwards. The first level excavated in this area (Level A1.1) is lacking of major structures but, judging from the findigs, including also a small hoard of 13 bronze coins, they are dated to the Hellenistic period. Below the Hellenistic level a series of floors has been found (Levels , all in relationship with two badly preserved walls, forming the north-eastern corned of a small space. The materials recovered from the floors and the accumulations in between allow to date their disposal to the Acemenid period, between 6th and 4th century BC. The findings in these levels of Area A1 are extraordinaty in terms of both quality and quantity. In fact, in addition fine ceramic sherds, among which many display painted decorations, a large amount terracottas have been found, many zoomorphic and one antropomorphic, representing a female figure. Added to a fragment of architectonic decoration, these findings let us suppose that the levels their are pertaining to were part of a worship area, of very likely relevance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the Area A2 of Op. A (squares 17.14-17.19-17.13-17.18) a first level dating to the Hellenistic period has been found (Level A2.1), below which four levels datin to the Late Iron Age have been found (A2.2-5). The first among these latter levels bears elements of a workshop area, equipped with a furnace, half interred ovens, working surfaces and rubbish pits with slags of various kind. During the 2013 campaing the exposition prosecuted of the imposing E-W mud brick wall unearthed in 2012, possibly dating to the 7th century. Thus, works revealed this wall to be 13 m long, straddling between squares 17.13 and 17.18.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Work in Op. B focused on the central area. Here the Medieval and Hellenistic levels (Levels B.1-4), already partially exposed in 2011 and 2012, have been first investigated. These, especially the Medieval ones, are characterized by a series of pits, several large to reach 3 m of diameter, cutting the preceeding levels of occupation. This heavily hindered the possibility to fully understand stratigraphical relationships between the different phases. The south-western sector of Op. B is better preserved compared to the central sector. In particular, stone structures and floors have been brought to light, associated to a Hellenistic house reused and modified in the Middle Age. The southern half of square 16.16 is entirely occupied by structures of a monumental building, whose main element is a massive 1m thick and 10m long mud brick wall provided with fine plastering (Levels B.5-7). This wall, oriented SE-NW forms to the eastern ending a corner with a NW-SE wall, preserving traces of a white plastering. In between this corner a deep sounding was opened that, while not yet reaching the original floor of the room, revealed the walls to be preserved for the extraordinary elevation of more than 2m. The deep sounding, moreover, reached several intermediate floor levels, indicating several stages of reutilization of the large structure after its first installation. The accumulations and the debris leaning against the wall and filling the large room produced ceramic materials dating to the Achemenid period. Moreover, in the bottom of the sounding a circular mud brick installation joining in a quarter of circle the two perpendicular walls has been found. In the filling of this installation two complete ceramic bowls have been found, both pertaining to a Late Iron Age horizon.

                    The new Operation opened in 2013 occupies the western limit of the lower terrace of Kınık Höyük (square 1.15). The first level here individuated, lying a few centimeters below the top soil, is hevily disturbed and dates to the Middle Age. This level (Level D.1) displays very different features from those of the Medieval settlement in Op. B, and some findings rather suggest a dating to the Byzantine period. If confirmed, this hypothesis would attest the presence at Kınık of a Byzantine settlement limited to the lower town and not involving the mound itself. In the north-eastern corner of Op. D a small space has been found, edged by stone walls. It is likely attributable to a Hellenistic phase (Level D.2), judging from the maretials produced by the fillings. Investigations south-west of this room suggest that it could have been associated to some productive activities. Below the Hellenistic level a small space has been unearthed (Level D.3), edged by two mud brick walls and by a small stone wall, maybe pertaining to a different phase. Judging from the hardness of the mud bricks, possibly produced as an effect of burning, the presence of many ash accumulations and the finding of an oven remainder, this was an industrial area, maybe for the processing of foodstuffs or even of metals, as apparently suggested by some slags retrieved in the surroundings. Ceramic materials, among which a fragment of a painted lekythos, allow a dating of Level D.3 to the Achemenid period.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2013 also the restoration work for the outer facade of the citadel wall have started. Functional to the restoration work, archaeological excavation has been carried out in the area, which brought to light the construction phase of the wall itself, i.e. the most ancient level so far reached at Kınık (Level A.8). Moreover, the excavation to better expose the facade lead to the reconnaissance of a rampart, covering the most ancient construction phase and associated to the most recent one.

<article>
    

<p>Since 2011, she is the geologist in charge of the archaeometric analyses of the pottery from the Kınık Höyük excavation.
Her research activity is addressed to reconstruct ancient production technologies and materials provenances, applying the analytical techniques used in Earth Sciences (i.e., optical microscopy, SEM-EDX, XRD, XRF, EPMA and Raman spectroscopy). The research interests of dr Basso can be summarized as follows: <br>
•	Archaeometric studies on medieval glass and glazed ceramics <br>
•	Mineralogical, petrographic and geochemical studies of archaeological pottery, aiming to unravel ancient technology and to characterize raw materials <br>
•	Diagnostic analyses on Romanesque stuccoworks in Lombardia <br>
•	Archaeometric analyses of mortars and stones of historic buildings <br>
Currently, she is working on the analysis of the Cobalt blue pigment in works of art, in order to trace the geological origin of the raw materials.

<article>
    

<p>Valentina Cinieri earned her Master's degree in Building Engineering and Architecture at the University of Pavia (Italy) in 2010 with the thesis "The restoration of the ancient hamlet Embresi (Piacenza, Italy)". In 2011 she took part in research activities about built heritage (preservation, energy efficiency of historical buildings, planned conservation) at the Interdepartmental Centre for Studies and Research on the Conservation of Cultural Heritage (CISRiC), and at the Department of Civil Engineering and Architecture (DICAr). She attended the postgraduate school in Civil and Architectural Engineering at the University of Pavia, and obtained her PhD in 2015 with the thesis “Widespread built heritage. A sustainable approach to conservation and management”, in which she proposed a lifecycle oriented approach for the conservation of the pre-industrial built heritage.
Since 2012 she is involved in study of building techniques and conservation planning of the archaeological heritage at Kinik Höyük (Southern Cappadocia, Turkey).
Currently she attended the postgraduate School in architectural Heritage and Lanscape at University of Genoa. The school is focused on issues of cultural built heritage preservation and it is arranged in lectures, workshops and design activities aimed to restoration of built heritage.
Her interests focus on ancient building technologies and sustainable preservation of historical buildings. She takes part at national and international conferences about built heritage preservation and building technologies.

<article>
    

<p>Pam Crabtree is an Associate Professor of Anthropology in the Anthropology Department and the Center for the Study of Human Origins at New York University. She joined the NYU faculty in 1990. Crabtree received her graduate training in anthropological archaeology and zooarchaeology at the University of Pennsylvania. Her research interests include animal domestication, the transition from foraging to farming, and the use of animal remains to reconstruct the herding patterns and hunting practices in complex societies. Most of Crabtree’s early research focused on the study of faunal remains from late Roman and Early and Middle Anglo-Saxon sites in eastern England. She has also worked on faunal remains from a wide variety of sites in Europe, the Middle East, Egypt, and historic North America. 
Crabtree works closely with her colleague and husband, Dr. Douglas Campana. Campana received his PhD in Near Eastern prehistory from Columbia University in 1981. He spent much of his career as an archaeologist for the US National Park Service, and he retired from the Park Service in 2006. In addition to the Kinik Höyük project, Crabtree and Campana have collaborated with their colleague, Dr. Susan Johnston, on the Dún Ailinne project in Ireland, and they have served as archaeozoologists for the Amheida project in Egypt and the Brandon Middle Saxon project in England.

She went on to the Institute of Egyptology and Ancient Near East at Johannes Gutenberg University (Mainz, Germany), and obtained her PhD in 2012 with the thesis “The Problematic of the Bed-Panel of Ugarit”.

Her interest focuses mostly on the Levant of the Late Bronze Age, with particular emphasis on the iconography. Moreover, she is actively engaged in the field of archaeology of the Iron Age in Central Anatolia in the joint excavation project of Kinik Höyük (ISAW and University of Pavia).

Her research project at ISAW is entitled  "Beyond Hybridism: Intercultural Connectivity in the Northern Levant During the Late Bronze Age", and will investigate, on the basis of the imagery represented on luxury items, how intercultural connectivity processes took place in the Northern Levant during the Late Bronze Age.

<p>In 2014, I graduated from the University of Pavia with a MA in “Ancient Philology, Literature and History”. I my thesis I deal with the ceramic production in Central Anatolia during the Late Iron Age, analyzing and discussing the results of archaeometrical and petrographic investigations conducted on relevant ceramic findings from Kınık Höyük. In addition to Kınık Höyük, I am also working in other archaeological expeditions in the Mediterranean area.

<article>
    

<p>I obtained my Master degree at the University of Pavia in 2009 with a thesis on the territorial administration in Syria during the 15th century BCE, with focus on the kingdom of Alalah IV. In January 2014, I earned a Ph.D. degree in Ancient Western Asian Studies at the University of Pavia, completing a dissertation on the political geography of South-Central Anatolia during the Hittite period. My research interest concerns the political geography, territoriality and spatial organization of authority in early complex empires and canton states, with focus on preclassical Anatolia and Syria. <br>

I took part to archaeological excavations and surveys in Syria, at Tell Ashara/Terqa (field director: Olivier Rouault, Université Lumière Lyon 2), where I worked as area supervisor and was responsible of the classification and restoration of lithic materials. In 2008 I started archaeological work in Turkey, which included the participation to surveys and excavations in Southern Cappadocia and a period of internship at the Museum of Niğde. <br>

At Kınık Höyük I am the supervisor of the work in Operation B, being responsible of the publication of the stratigraphy.

<article>
    

<p>I received my BA in Classics and Oriental studies in 2009 and my MA in Ancient Near Eastern Studies in 2012 at the University of Pavia (Italy). In my MA thesis I examined a critical edition of a Hittite ritual text of Hurro-Hittite tradition related to the religion of the Netherworld. My research interest is in Anatolian philology and Hittite studies, in particular related to the complex cultural and religious background of Anatolia within the network of Ancient Near Eastern and Mediterranean traditions. Besides the philological studies, I have worked from 2011 in the archaeological field for the NYU and Pavia University excavations at Kınık Höyük in Turkey (Cappadocia). At ISAW I intend to further investigate the features of Hittite religion in the context of ancient Mediterranean cultural background and pursue my work and study in the archaeological field.

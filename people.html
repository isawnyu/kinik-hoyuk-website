<article>
    

<p>She has been the geologist in charge of archaeometric analyses of ceramic sherds from the Kınık Höyük 
excavation since 2011. After the acquisition of the portable X-ray fluorescence spectrometer ELIO XGLab 
in 2015, she is also in charge for running the pXRF lab and analyzing all findings.
Her research activity is addressed to reconstruct ancient production technologies and materials 
provenances, applying the analytical techniques used in Earth Sciences (i.e., optical microscopy, 
SEM-EDX, XRD, XRF, EPMA and Raman spectroscopy). The research interests of dr Basso can be summarized as follows: <br>
• Archaeometric studies on glass and glazed ceramics (from Ellenistic to Renaissance time) <br>
• Mineralogical, petrographic and geochemical studies of archaeological pottery, aiming to unravel ancient technology and to 
characterize raw materials <br>
• Diagnostic analyses on Romanesque stuccoworks in Lombardia <br>
• Archaeometric analyses of mortars and stones of historic buildings <br>
• Analysis of Cobalt blue pigment in works of art, in order to trace the geological origin of the raw materials. <br>

<article>
    
<p>I received a BA in Cultural Heritage Sciences and a MA in Archaeology at University of Milan. My BA and MA were focused on European Proto-history (Bronze and Iron Ages). In 2008 I began to work as a professional archaeologist. Through collaborations with Italian research institutes and private firms I have participated in a number of research and development-led excavations in varied cultural and chronological contexts. Besides my archaeological field work, I have conducted extensive research within environmental archeology, thanks to a long time collaboration with the Laboratory of Palynology and Paleoecology of the Italian National Council of Research – CNR (with a focus on archaeobotany and ethnobotany) and a research fellowship at the Earth Sciences Department of the Milan-Bicocca University (research topic the reconstruction of the Late Holocene climatic change in Northern Italy). Currently I am PhD student at NYU-ISAW, with archaeology and environmental history of Anatolia as the central topic of my research.

<p>Valentina Cinieri earned her Master's degree in Building Engineering and Architecture at the University of Pavia (Italy) in 2010 with the thesis "The restoration of the ancient hamlet Embresi (Piacenza, Italy)". In 2011 she took part in research activities about built heritage (preservation, energy efficiency of historical buildings, planned conservation) at the Interdepartmental Centre for Studies and Research on the Conservation of Cultural Heritage (CISRiC), and at the Department of Civil Engineering and Architecture (DICAr). She attended the postgraduate school in Civil and Architectural Engineering at the University of Pavia, and obtained her PhD in 2015 with the thesis “Widespread built heritage. A sustainable approach to conservation and management”, in which she proposed a lifecycle oriented approach for the conservation of the pre-industrial built heritage.
Since 2012 she is involved in study of building techniques and conservation planning of the archaeological heritage at Kinik Höyük (Southern Cappadocia, Turkey).
Currently she attended the postgraduate School in architectural Heritage and Lanscape at University of Genoa. The school is focused on issues of cultural built heritage preservation and it is arranged in lectures, workshops and design activities aimed to restoration of built heritage.
Her interests focus on ancient building technologies and sustainable preservation of historical buildings. She takes part at national and international conferences about built heritage preservation and building technologies.

<article>
    

<p>Pam Crabtree is an Associate Professor of Anthropology in the Anthropology Department and the Center for the 
Study of Human Origins at New York University. She joined the NYU faculty in 1990. Crabtree received her graduate 
training in anthropological archaeology and zooarchaeology at the University of Pennsylvania. Her research interests 
include animal domestication, the transition from foraging to farming, and the use of animal remains to reconstruct 
the herding patterns and hunting practices in complex societies. Most of Crabtree’s early research focused on the 
study of faunal remains from late Roman and Early and Middle Anglo-Saxon sites in eastern England. She has also 
worked on faunal remains from a wide variety of sites in Europe, the Middle East, Egypt, and historic North America. 
Crabtree works closely with her colleague and husband, Dr. Douglas Campana. Campana received his PhD in Near Eastern 
prehistory from Columbia University in 1981. He spent much of his career as an archaeologist for the US National 
Park Service, and he retired from the Park Service in 2006. In addition to the Kinik Höyük project, Crabtree and 
Campana have collaborated with their colleague, Dr. Susan Johnston, on the Dún Ailinne project in Ireland, and they 
have served as archaeozoologists for the Amheida project in Egypt and the Brandon Middle Saxon project in England.

<article>
    

<p>In 2014, I graduated from the University of Pavia with a MA in “Ancient Philology, Literature and History”. In my thesis I deal with the ceramic production in Central Anatolia during the Late Iron Age, analyzing and discussing the results of archaeometrical and petrographic investigations conducted on relevant ceramic findings from Kınık Höyük. In addition to Kınık Höyük, I also worked in other archaeological expeditions in the Mediterranean area. Currently I’m completing the second year of two-year Specialization at the School of Archeology at University of Milan and my research is focused on the analysis of methodological problems related to the archeology of the Ancient Near East.

Professor at the Institute for the History of Ancient Civilizations, Northeast Normal University (Changchun, China). 
Since Fall 2016 I am research fellow at the Istituto Italiano per la Storia Antica (Rome, Italy), where I am 
continuing research on the ancient political landscapes of the Eastern Mediterranean region. Other academic affiliations 
include the University of Pavia and the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World, NYU. <br>

I took part in archaeological excavations and surveys in Syria, at Tell Ashara/Terqa (field director: Olivier Rouault, 
Université Lumière Lyon 2), where I worked as area supervisor and was responsible of the classification and restoration 
of lithic materials. In 2008 I started archaeological work in Turkey, which included the participation to surveys and 
excavations in Southern Cappadocia and a period of internship at the Museum of Niğde.
